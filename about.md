I am currently finishing up a Master's of Science in Information (MSI) program at the [University of Michigan School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/). Before that, I received an MS in physical chemistry doing some work on extending quantum dynamics models for charge transfer systems. As of summer 2020, I am working as the summer librarian for the [University of Michigan Biological Station](https://lsa.umich.edu/umbs), as well as working on handling data workflows for several Zooniverse projects being run by the investigators of the [CHANGES grant](https://www.akthomer.com/current-projects) with help from the [Shapiro Design Lab](https://www.lib.umich.edu/shapiro-design-lab).

Academically and professionally, I'm generally interested in the intersection of scientific research data and information science. A few areas I'm particularly interested in:

- Linked data & semantic technologies
- Knowledge formalization (ontologies & taxonomies)
- Research data curation & management
- Data carpentry & data processing/cleaning workflows
- Improving documentation and training materials for basic data skills
- Building better data repositories for fields in need of them
- Citizen & community science + science outreach
- Increasing library engagement in facilitating more open & accessible sciences

### More Information

Beyond the above, I'm a big fan of games, heavy music, reading, and nature. I have an enthusiastic (if amateur) interest in ecology, astronomy, mathematics, linguistics, and analytic philosophy. I believe strongly in the ability of education and understanding to enrich our lives and better our world.
