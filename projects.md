#### UM Biostation library collection development
Assessing the UM Biostation's library collections for sufficiency in a few key areas: GIS, analytical chemistry, and Native American cultures & histories.

#### [UM Biostation data](https://mfield.umich.edu/)
Helping the UM Biostation's data manager Jason Tallant generate metadata for student and faculty papers related to the Biostation, 
as well as doing some high-level curation for Biostation datasets.

#### [CHANGES project](https://www.akthomer.com/current-projects#h.p_wWFjIATg6bii)
Assisting the CHANGES investigators with Zooniverse data processing as well as fitting the data to an appropriate data model for 
eventual upload to a database or repository.

#### Ann Arbor Biodiversity Data
Helping the City of Ann Arbor crosswalk its biodiversity Access databases to Darwin Core for upload to GBIF and other biodiversity data aggregators. 

## Previous projects

#### Denver USGS Fossil data reconciliation
In 2018, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) took curatorial responsibility for a USGS fossil collection, along with associated digital materials, that had been distributed among several locations following the USGS Denver Paleontology and Stratigraphy (P&S) research programâ€™s closure in 1995. I worked with several of my peers at UMSI to help the NMNH informatics team prepare to reconcile the digital files (namely the inventories) across the physical collection. We worked to identify the most up-to-date and complete versions of the many inventories, as well as copies, duplicates, and redundant information. We also made suggestions for cleaning, organizing, and maintaining these files to make them more fit for use, as well as offered recommendations for future curation steps. 

#### Unearthing Michigan Ecological Data (2019 - 2020)
Worked with Dr. Justin Schell and other members of the Shapiro Design Lab and UM Biological Station to run a Zooniverse project to classify data types in scanned student papers associated with the Biological station. Used the classification data from the project to update papers in UM's Deep Blue repository with searchable metadata tags indicating data types.

#### UM Tech services BIBFRAME assessment (2019)
Worked with the UM Library's technical services department to assess the quality and fitness-for-use of a large batch of MARC records that had recently been converted to the new RDF-based BIBFRAME standard as part of the SHARE-VDE initiative. My analysis focused on the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm used to group together instances of the same "work," though I also searched for issues with the converted data values themselves.

#### PROV Pilot project (2019)
Worked with Dr. Andrea Thomer at UMSI to assess the applicability of the [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) to unstructured dataset descriptions, as part of a broader push to develop a semantically-rich text editor for annotating dataset READMEs and like free-text descriptions.

#### Compute-to-Learn (2015 - 2017)
Worked in the UM Chemistry department with my advisor Dr. Eitan Geva, Chemistry lecturer Dr. Amy Gottfried, and several peers to help develop interactive Mathematica demonstrations, documentation for how to make these demos, and set up a studio where students could learn physical chemistry concepts via creating their own Mathematica demos.
