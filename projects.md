#### UM Biostation library collection development
Assessing the UM Biostation's library collections for sufficiency in a few key areas: GIS, analytical chemistry, and Native American cultures & histories.

#### [UM Biostation data](https://mfield.umich.edu/)
Helping the UM Biostation's data manager Jason Tallant generate metadata for student and faculty papers related to the Biostation, 
as well as doing some high-level curation for Biostation datasets.

#### [CHANGES project](https://www.akthomer.com/current-projects#h.p_wWFjIATg6bii)
Assisting the CHANGES investigators with Zooniverse data processing as well as fitting the data to appropriate data models for 
eventual upload to a database or repository.

#### Ann Arbor Biodiversity Data
Helping the City of Ann Arbor crosswalk its biodiversity Access databases to Darwin Core for upload to GBIF and other biodiversity data aggregators. 

## Previous projects

#### Unearthing Michigan Ecological Data (2019 - 2020)
Worked with Dr. Justin Schell and other members of the Shapiro Design Lab and UM Biological Station to run a Zooniverse project to classify data types in scanned student papers associated with the Biological station. Used the classification data from the project to update papers in UM's Deep Blue repository with searchable metadata tags indicating data types.

#### UM Tech services BIBFRAME assessment (2019)
Worked with the UM Library's technical services department to assess the quality and fitness-for-use of a large batch of MARC records that had recently been converted to the new RDF-based BIBFRAME standard. My analysis focused on the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm used to group together instances of the same "work."

#### PROV Pilot project (2019)
Worked with Dr. Andrea Thomer at UMSI to assess the applicability of the [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) to unstructured dataset descriptions, as part of a broader push to develop a semantically-rich text editor for annotating dataset READMEs and like free-text descriptions.

#### Compute-to-Learn (2015 - 2017)
Worked in the UM Chemistry department with my advisor Dr. Eitan Geva, Chemistry lecturer Dr. Amy Gottfried, and several peers to help develop interactive Mathematica demonstrations, documentation for how to make these demos, and set up a studio where students could learn physical chemistry concepts via creating their own Mathematica demos.
